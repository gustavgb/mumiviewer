The excellent movie **"Comet in Moominland"** exists in Danish on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6DqZ6vCL9E), but due to copyright issues, the author has had to both flip the video and place in weirdly in the corner, while white balls are flowing across the screen; in essence doing everything to confuse the algorithm. While it is surely appreciated that an individual has shared this wonderful movie with us, we cannot enjoy it completely in this format - until now!

This repo contains a website that embeds this specific video and undoes the distracting features, so you can enjoy this with friends and family.

## Usage
